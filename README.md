# Predicting Diabetes Using the Pima Indian Dataset

This repository contains the work for the UNC MADS DATA780 final project, where we explore machine learning techniques for predicting diabetes using the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The project includes a proposal, the code for the project, a presentation, and other resources that were utilized throughout the project.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements. The project leverages the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and explores various machine learning techniques including artificial neural networks (ANNs) and other classification methods.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **`proposal/`**: Contains the project proposal outlining the goals, methods, and expected outcomes of the project.
- **`project/`**: Includes the code and notebooks used to preprocess the data, build the models, and evaluate performance. This folder also contains all relevant scripts and model checkpoints.
- **`presentation/`**: The final presentation slides that summarize the project, including key findings, results, and next steps.
- **`data/`**: The Pima Indian Diabetes dataset used for training and testing the models. The dataset is stored in CSV format.
- **`resources/`**: Any additional resources, references, or papers that were used to guide the project, such as research papers or documentation on specific machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Pima Indian Diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which contains diagnostic measurements for 768 female patients, including features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and age. The target variable is whether the patient has diabetes.

## Project Components

1. **Proposal**: A detailed plan for the project, including the problem statement, proposed methods, and expected results.
2. **Code**: All code related to data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
3. **Presentation**: A final presentation of the project's findings.
4. **Resources**: Supporting documents and literature that helped guide the project.
